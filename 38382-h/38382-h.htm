<p>The plant here represented has long been cultivated as a
greenhouse plant in this country under the name of <i>Convolvulus
Cantabrica</i>, but it differs so essentially from that plant, as figured
and described by Prof. <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span> in his <i>Flora Austr.</i> and
accords so little with the other species described by <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>,
that we have been induced to regard it as a perfectly distinct
species; in most points it agrees with <i>Convolvulus Cneorum</i>, but
differs in having leaves much narrower, more pointed, and
less silky.</p>

<p>It strikes most readily from cuttings, is a hardy greenhouse
plant, and flowers during most of the Summer, qualities which
many of the modern and more shewy greenhouse plants
cannot boast.</p>

<p>The precise time of its introduction here, together with its
particular place of growth, we have not as yet been able
satisfactorily to ascertain.</p>

<p>The Amaryllis lutea is a hardy perennial bulbous plant, a
native of Spain, and other of the more Southern parts of
Europe, and was cultivated in our Gardens in the time of <span class="smcap">Gerard</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>.</p>

<p>Flora, who commences her revolutionary reign, by enlivening
the flower border with the Spring Crocus, and its numerous
varieties, terminates it with flowers equally pleasing, and of
similar hues; thus we have the present plant, the Saffron
Crocus, and the Colchicum, flowering nearly at the same time,
from the end of September, through October, and sometimes
part of November.</p>

<p>Similar as the Amaryllis is to the yellow Spring Crocus, in
the colour, and form of its flowers, it differs obviously in the
number of its stamina, the breadth of its leaves, and the size
and colour of its root.</p>

<p>Authors describe it as varying in size, in the breadth of its
leaves, the height of its flowers, and multiplication of the
Corolla.</p>

<p>The Dutch Florists export it under the title of yellow
Colchicum, following the name of some of the old writers.</p>

<p>It succeeds best in a soil moderately moist, in which it
increases considerably by offsets, and flowers to the most
advantage when the roots have remained for some few years
undisturbed in the same spot.</p>

<p>We are happy in having it in our power to lay before our
readers a representation of the Caper shrub, whose blossoms are
rarely seen in this country, though its flower-buds are in very
general use as a pickle; indeed, so great is their consumption,
that they form a very considerable article of commerce.</p>

<p>The plant grows spontaneously in the more southern parts of
Europe, especially in Italy and the Levant; in its wild state
it forms a shrub of low growth, having numerous, spreading,
spinous branches, somewhat thickly beset with smooth roundish
leaves; the blossoms grow alternately on the branches, and
when the plant begins to flower, one opens generally every
other morning, but so delicate are its parts, that on a hot
summer's day it fades before noon: the petals are white; the
filaments, which are extremely numerous, are white below, and
of a rich purple above; in these the beauty of the flower
chiefly consists, as in the pistillum or pointal does its great
singularity; at first view, one would be led to conclude, that
the part so conspicuous in the centre of the flower was the style
terminated by the stigma in the usual way; but if we trace
this part of the flower to a more advanced state, we shall perceive,
that what we took for the style, was merely an elongation
of the flower-stalk, and what we took for the stigma, was
in reality the germen placed on it, crowned with a minute
stigma, without any intervening style; this germen swells, turns
downward, and ultimately becomes the seed-vessel, rarely
ripening in this country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miller</span> observes, that these plants are with difficulty preserved
in England, for they delight to grow in crevices of
rocks, and the joints of old walls and ruins, and always thrive
best in an horizontal position; so that when they are planted
either in pots or the full ground, they rarely thrive, though
they may be kept alive for many years.</p>

<p>It flowers in May and June, and is usually raised from seeds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> regards it as a greenhouse plant, and informs
us that it was cultivated by <span class="smcap">Gerard</span> in 1596.</p>

indeed a plant recently introduced to this country from the
Cape; we saw it last Summer in great perfection, at Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Lee</span> and <span class="smcap">Kennedy's</span>, Hammersmith; it forms a small neat
shrub, somewhat like the <i>Phylica ericoides</i>, is a hardy greenhouse

<p>The <i>Catananche cærulea</i> is a native of the South of France,
where it grows in hilly situations that are stony: it is a perennial
herbaceous plant, moderately hardy, and has long been
cultivated in our gardens, Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> says, by <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>
in 1640: <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, who treats of it in his Dictionary, describes
it as a pretty ornament to a garden, and one that is easily kept
within bounds; there is certainly much about it to excite
our admiration, more especially in the structure of the calyx,
and the florets: the flowers, which are of a pale blue colour
with a dark eye, make their appearance from July to October.</p>

<p>It is propagated by seeds, which <span class="smcap">Miller</span> recommends to
be sown in the Spring; the seedlings should be transplanted
in the Autumn, into the borders where they are to remain;
it may also be increased by slips: the plant requires a situation
moderately dry, and is most productive of flowers and seeds
when it stands long in one spot.</p>

<p>In the 14th <i>edit.</i> of the <i>Systema Vegetab.</i> of Prof. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>,
mention is made of a variety with double flowers, which we
believe has not been seen in this country.</p>

<p>The Guernsey Lily, as it is most commonly called, is originally
a native of Japan; where it is described to grow by
<span class="smcap">Kæmpfer</span> and <span class="smcap">Thunberg</span>, who visited that island, the latter
says on the hills about Nagasaki, from thence roots are said
to have been introduced to the garden of <span class="smcap">Johannes Morinus</span>
at Paris, in which it flowered, October 1634: its introduction
to this country, which was subsequent to that date, as Dr.
<span class="smcap">Douglass</span> relates in his <i>Monographia</i> on this plant, "happened
by a very singular melancholy accident, of which Dr. <span class="smcap">Morison</span>,
who no doubt had it from some persons then residing
in Guernsey, gives us the following account: A Dutch or
English ship, it is uncertain which, coming from Japan,
with some of the roots of this flower on board, was cast
away on the island of Guernsey; the roots were thrown upon
a sandy shore, and so by the force of the winds and waves,
were soon buried in sand; there they remained for some
years, and afterwards, to the great surprise and admiration
of the inhabitants, the flowers appeared in all their pomp
and beauty." Some of these soon made their appearance in
this country: Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> relates, that the plant was cultivated
here in 1659, by General <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, at Wimbledon.</p>

<p>Fatal as Guernsey proved to the unfortunate mariners, it
afforded the roots of our plant a soil and situation apparently
congenial to their own; in that island they have flourished
ever since, there they are propagated in the open borders of
the flower-garden with the least possible trouble, flowering
most readily, but we believe never producing any ripe seeds;
from thence most of the roots which flower with the curious
here, are yearly imported in the Autumn.</p>

<p>In Guernsey, the cold of the Winter is far less intense than
with us; many of those plants which we keep in our greenhouses,
stand with them in the open ground; the superior
mildness of the climate enables them to cultivate this plant
with more success than we can do, even perhaps with all the
expence and trouble to which we might subject ourselves; to
such, however, whose situations may be favourable, and who
may be fond of making experiments, we recommend the
perusal of <span class="smcap">Fairchild's</span> Directions, a practical Gardener of
great ingenuity, and who appears to have had much experience
in the culture of this plant<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>.</p>

<p>It is usual to plant the imported bulbs in pots of sand, or
light loam, as soon as they arrive, and place them in the parlour
window, or greenhouse; they blossom in September and
October; the flowers, which continue about a month in perfection,
are inodorous, but make up for that deficiency by the
superior splendour of their colours: Dr. <span class="smcap">Douglass</span> thus
describes them, each flower when in its prime looks like a fine
gold tissue wrought on a rose-coloured ground, but when it
begins to fade and decay, it looks more like a silver tissue, or
what they call a pink colour: when we look upon the flower
in full sun-shine, each leaf appears to be studded with thousands
of little diamonds, sparkling and glittering with a most
surprising and agreeable lustre; but if we view the same by
candle-light, these numerous specks or spangles look more
like fine gold dust.</p>

<p>Both <span class="smcap">Kæmpfer</span> and <span class="smcap">Thunberg</span> agree, that the Japanese
regard the root as poisonous.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> "They love a light earth, made with dung and sand, and a little lime rubbish with
it does very well, it keeps the roots sound; for if the earth be too stiff or wet, you may
keep them for many years before they blow. If they are in pots, they should be put in
the house in Winter, to keep them from the severe frosts, which are apt to rot the roots.
The time of moving them is when they have no leaves on the root, that is from June to
August: those that come with six leaves this year, seldom fail blowing the next year:
they need not be put in fresh earth above once in two or three years: by this method of
management I have had the same roots blow again in four years time. The many miscarriages
that happen to the Guernsey Lily, are by letting the leaves be killed by the
fierceness of the frost in Winter, or by cutting them off, as some people do, when they
are green, which will so much weaken the plants, that they may keep them twenty
years and not have them blow; by the above management, where there is a stock, there
will be continually some blowing.
</p><p>
"<span class="smcap">Miller</span> recommends for these roots the following compost: Take a third-part of
fresh virgin earth from a pasture-ground which is light, then put near an equal part of
sea-sand, to which you should add rotten dung and sifted lime rubbish, of each an equal
quantity."
</p><p>
The great business in the culture of this flower, next to a proper soil and situation,
seems to consist in giving the plant as much air as possible, and in preserving the foliage
in the Winter from the injury of frost.</p></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> informs us in his <i>Hortus Kewensis</i>, that the
charming annual here figured, the liveliness of whose colours
no paint can express, was cultivated by <span class="smcap">Miller</span> in 1739;
seeing it is a plant of such beauty, and honoured with so
distinguished an appellation, it is singular that it should not by
this time have made its way more generally into our gardens.</p>

<p>The Cockle of our corn-fields is an ornamental plant, the
present species resembles it; but while the plant itself is much
smaller, its flowers are proportionably larger, and their colours
more vivid.</p>

<p>It is an annual of ready growth, a native of Sicily and the
Levant, flowering in July and August, and ripening its seeds
in September and October.</p>

<p>It appears to most advantage when several plants of it grow
together; the best mode, therefore, is to sow about a dozen
seeds early in April on the several spots of the flower-border
where you intend they shall remain; no other care is necessary
than to keep the plants free from weeds and vermin.</p>

<p>We know of no figure of this plant, the first and only account
of which is to be found in the <i>Hort. Kew.</i> of Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>;
there it is specifically described, and from thence we discover
that it was introduced from the Canary Islands, where it is a
native, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>, in 1779.</p>

<p>It is a shrubby plant of low growth, producing numerous
fleshy leaves growing thickly together, which being evergreen,
and making a pretty appearance the year through, render the
plant worthy a place in all general collections at least, of
greenhouse plants; and though it cannot vie with many of the
more shewy high-priced novelties, it is an abiding plant, not
subject to casualties, while many of those are here to day and
gone to morrow.</p>

<p>It throws up its flowering stems, supporting numerous,

readily propagated by cuttings.</p>

<p>Many of the plants of this genus diffuse an agreeable odour,
which renders them most desirable objects for the flower-garden:
this quality the present species possesses in a superior
degree to most others; a few of its flowers communicate to a
nosegay a delicate and most delicious smell, or placed in a
vial of water they will even scent a small apartment<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>: it is to
be regretted, however, that the blossoms, unless placed in
water, from their extreme delicacy, flag soon after they are
gathered.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether the <i>Dianthus superbus</i> of <i>Miller's
Dict. ed. 6. 4to.</i> be our plant; if it be, the description is not
drawn up with that accuracy which distinguishes his descriptions
in general; the mode of culture, however, which he
recommends is strictly applicable to it, as the plant rarely
continues in vigour more than two years, and as it is in its
greatest beauty the first year of its flowering, he recommends
that young plants should be annually raised for succession from
seeds, which are plentifully produced; the seeds of this plant
ought therefore to be kept in the shops with annuals and biennials.</p>

<p>The <i>Dianthus superbus</i> is a native of Germany, Switzerland,
France, and Denmark: <span class="smcap">Clusius</span> found it growing in
the moist meadows about Vienna, and on the borders of woods
adjoining to such, with some of its flowers white, others
purplish; <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> describes them of these two colours,
but says the most ordinary with us are pure white, which is
contrary to what we now find them: they are rarely produced
before August, from which period they will continue frequently
to blossom till October.</p>

<p>The Spring is the best time for sowing its seeds; the plants
require no very nice or particular treatment.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> This fragrance has been noticed by all the old authors who have treated of
the plant: <span class="smcap">Clusius</span> describes the flowers as <i>suavissimi odoris et è longinquo nares
ferientis</i>, of which words <span class="smcap">Parkinson's</span> are almost a literal translation "of a
most fragrant sent, comforting the spirits and senses afarre off."</p></div>

<p>By the name of Dittany of Crete, the species of Origanum
here figured, has long been known in this country as a medicinal
plant; to the purposes of physic it still indeed continues
to be applied, as imported in a dried state from the Levant:
when bruised, the whole plant gives forth an aromatic fragrance,
highly grateful; as an ornamental plant, it has also been long,
and is now, very generally cultivated in this country. <span class="smcap">Turner</span>,
whose Herbal was printed in 1568, writes thus concerning it,
"I have sene it growynge in England in Maister Riches gardin
naturally, but it groweth no where ellis that I know of,
saving only in Candy." As at this period no idea was entertained
of a greenhouse, the plant must have been cultivated in
the open ground, where it would doubtless grow readily, if secured
from the severity of the weather, it being more hardy
than many plants usually kept in greenhouses.</p>

<p>This plant is at all times ornamental, but more particularly
so when in flower, in which state it appears during most of the
summer and autumnal months.</p>

<p>It is usually increased by cuttings, which strike readily.</p>

<p><i>Hermannia</i> is a genus of plants named in honour of Dr.
<span class="smcap">Paul Herman</span>, a Dutch Botanist of great celebrity, author
of the <i>Paradisus Batavus</i>, and other valuable works: twenty-six
species are enumerated in the 13th edition of the <i>Syst.
Naturæ</i> of <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> by Prof. <span class="smcap">Gmelin</span>, and eight in the
<i>Hortus Kewensis</i> of Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>; most of those in the latter work
are cultivated in the nurseries near town: they form a set of
the more hardy greenhouse plants, grow readily, and flower
freely; their blossoms are for the most part yellow, and have
a considerable affinity with those of the <i>Mahernia</i>.</p>

<p>The present species flowers very early in the spring, from
February to May, producing a great profusion of bloom
during that period; is a native of the Cape, and was cultivated
by Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, in 1728.</p>

<p>It rarely ripens its seeds with us, but is readily increased
by cuttings.</p>

<p>The nurserymen near town regard this plant as the <i>grossularifolia</i>
of <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>, calling another, equally common species,
with longer and narrower leaves, <i>alnifolia</i>, and which does not
appear to be described by <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> or mentioned by Mr.

<p>In the summer of 1794, towards the end of July, the Gnaphalium
here figured, the most magnificent and shewy of all
the species hitherto introduced to this country, flowered in
great perfection at Messrs. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> and <span class="smcap">Kennedy's</span>, Hammersmith:
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> informs me, that he raised it from seeds
given him by Capt. <span class="smcap">William Paterson</span>, author of a Narrative
of four journeys into the country of the Hottentots, and
Caffraria, and who has most laudably exerted himself in introducing
many new and interesting plants to this country; this
gentleman assured Mr. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, that the plant was found in a
wild state, five hundred miles from the Cape, on the borders
of the Caffre country, from whence the natives bring bundles
of the dried plant to the Cape as presents; in the state the
plant has long since been imported from that fertile coast: if
we mistake not, a specimen of this sort is figured in <span class="smcap">Petiver's</span>
works, and a coloured representation is given of it in <span class="smcap">Edwards's</span>
History of Birds, taken from a dried plant, brought from the
Cape, by Capt. <span class="smcap">Isaac Worth</span>, in 1749.</p>

<p>The plants we saw were about a foot and a half high, the
stalks shrubby, and but little branched; the foliage and
flowers as represented on the plate.</p>

<p>Several of the Gnaphaliums it is well known are liable to be
killed by moisture, especially in the winter season; during
that time, this plant in particular, should be kept as dry as
possible, and, if convenient, on a shelf, separate from the other
plants of the greenhouse; when it is necessary to give it water,
it should never come in contact with the foliage or flowers:
with these precautions it may be kept very well in a good
greenhouse, in which it should remain, even during summer.</p>

<p>It may be raised from seeds, and also from cuttings.</p>

<p>There are few flowers that do not secrete from some kind of
a glandular substance, honey, or nectar, to a greater or smaller
amount; in those of the present genus, this liquid is particularly
abundant, even dropping from the flowers of the <i>major</i>, in
considerable quantity; in the present species it flows not so
copiously, but is retained in the lower part of the blossom, and
is of a dark brown colour, an unusual phenomenon.</p>

<p>There are only two species of this genus described, the <i>major</i>
and the <i>minor</i>, both of which are cultivated in our nurseries;
the <i>major</i> is by far the most common, the most hardy, and the
most ornamental plant; its foliage indeed is peculiarly elegant:
this species will succeed in the open border, especially if
placed at the foot of a wall with a south or south-west aspect,
taking care to cover the root to a considerable depth with rotten
tan in severe frosts: the <i>minor</i> is always kept in the greenhouse,
in which, when it has acquired a certain age, it flowers
regularly in the spring, and constantly so, as far as we have
observed of the plants in Chelsea Garden; Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> says in
August, and <span class="smcap">Commelin</span> the summer through.</p>

<p>The <i>Melianthus minor</i> grows to the height of three, four, or
five feet; its stem, which is shrubby, during the flowering season
is apt to exhibit a naked appearance, having fewer leaves on
it at that period, and those not of their full size; but this,
perhaps, may in some degree be owing to the plant's being
placed at the back of others.</p>

<p>The foliage when bruised has an unpleasant smell.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Cape, and, according to Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>,
was cultivated by the Duchess of <span class="smcap">Beaufort</span>, in 1708; is
propagated readily by cuttings.</p>

<p>The seeds of this species of Mimosa having been sent over
in plenty, with some of the first vegetable productions of New
South-Wales, and growing readily, the plant has been raised
by many cultivators in this country; Mr. <span class="smcap">Hoy</span>, gardener to
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Northumberland</span>, produced a specimen of it
in flower at a meeting of the Linnean Society in 1790; it is
a shrub of quick growth, and a ready blower: a plant of it
in the stove of Chelsea-Garden has this year (May 10, 1795)
produced ripe pods, and perfect seeds. In the greenhouse,
where it flowers from February to April, the blossoms go off
without shewing any tendency to produce fruit.</p>

<p>It is first described by Dr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, in the Transactions of
the Linnean Society; the leaves in the plants that have fallen
under our notice have not accorded exactly with those he has
described, having neither been of a glaucous green colour,
according to the usual acceptation of that term, nor very much
undulated; and though those of an individual plant may have
presented such an appearance, we are persuaded they do not do
so generally when growing and in good health.</p>

flowers to the <i>E. ventricosa</i>, as these in their shape resemble a
flask or bottle, especially of that kind in which water is usually
kept, we have named it <i>ampullacea</i>; it is of very modern introduction.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June 1784, we had the pleasure to see a
small plant of this species in flower, with Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>,
Nurseryman, Turnham-Green, an unwearied and ingenious
cultivator of this beautiful tribe of plants in particular, the
richness of whose collection will appear in the subsequent list;
by him it was raised from Cape seeds, though not more than
the height of ten inches, it produced eighteen branches, most
of which put forth flowers at their summits; we counted sixty-six
blossoms on this small plant.</p>

<p>The leaves are short, linear, somewhat triangular, rigid,
edged with fine crooked hairs, very visible when magnified,
and terminating in a mucro or point, on the older branches
recurved and mostly eight-rowed; each branch is usually terminated
by four or five flowers, at first growing closely together,
and covered so strongly with a glutinous substance,
as to look as if varnished, and which is so adhesive as to catch
ants and small flies; as the flowering advances, they separate
more widely from each other, and finally a young branch
grows out of the centre from betwixt them; the true calyx is
composed of four lanceolate leaves, sitting close to and glued
as it were to the corolla; besides these, there are several other
leaves, which might be mistaken for those of the calyx, but
which may with more propriety be called Bracteæ or Floral-leaves;
some of these, like the calyx, are wholly red, others
red and green mixed together, and broader than the leaves of
the plant; the flowers are about an inch and a quarter in
length, inflated below, and contracted above into a long narrow
neck, dilating again so as to form a kind of knob, in which
the antheræ are contained, just below the limb, which divides
into four somewhat ovate obtuse segments, the upper side of
these segments is of a very pale flesh colour, the under side
of them as well as the dilated part just below them bright
red, the body of the flower flesh colour, marked with eight
longitudinal stripes, of a deeper hue; filaments eight, antheræ
within the tube; style projecting about the eighth of an inch
beyond the corolla; stigma, a round glutinous head.</p>

<p>The flowers as they decay become of a deeper red colour,
and finally pale brown, still retaining their form and appearing
to advantage;&mdash;hitherto the plant has produced no seeds
here, is increased with difficulty either by cuttings or layers,
but with most certainty in the latter way.</p>

<p>The <i>Hermannia</i> here figured is a plant of humble growth,
forming a small bushy shrub, a foot or a foot and a half in
height, and producing numerous flowers thinly scattered over
the branches, the greatest part of the summer; it is this disposition
which it has of flowering so freely, that renders it a
desirable plant for the greenhouse, in which it is commonly
kept, and of which it is an old inhabitant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dillenius</span> has figured it in his admirable work the <i>Hortus

cultivated in Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherard's</span> celebrated garden at Eltham
prior to that date.</p>

cuttings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, in his <i>Hortus Kewensis</i>, has inserted this species
of Amaryllis, as named and described by the younger
<span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>; he informs us, that it is a native of the West-Indies,
and was introduced by Dr. <span class="smcap">William Pitcairn</span>, in
1778: as its time of flowering is not mentioned, we may presume,
that it had not blossomed in the royal garden when
the publication before mentioned first made its appearance; it
no doubt has since, as we have seen it in that state in the
collections of several Nurserymen, particularly those of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Grimwood</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Colvill</span>.</p>

<p>It flowers towards the end of April.</p>

<p>The flowering stem rises above the foliage, to the height of
about a foot or more, produces from one to three flowers,
similar to, but not quite so large as those of the Mexican
Amaryllis, to which it is nearly related; it differs however
from that plant essentially in this, that the lower part of the
flower projects further than the upper, which gives to its mouth
that obliquity which <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> describes.</p>

<p>The spatha is composed of two leaves, which standing up
at a certain period of the plant's flowering like ears, give to the
whole flower a fancied resemblance of a horse's head; whether
<span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> derived his name of <i>equestris</i> from this circumstance
or not, he does not condescend to inform us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> regards it as a greenhouse plant; like those of many
of the Ixias, however, the bulbs are of the more tender kind.</p>

<p>It is propagated by offsets, but not very readily.</p>

<p>The <i>Othonna pectinata</i> is a native of Africa, a long-established
and common plant in greenhouses, having been cultivated by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, in 1731; it recommends itself chiefly on account
of its foliage, which forms a pleasing contrast to the
darker greens of other plants.</p>

<p>It flowers in May and June, is moderately hardy, and readily
increased by cuttings.</p>

<p>In many collections we meet with old plants of it three or
four feet high; formerly, when greenhouse plants were few
in numbers and the houses large, it might be proper to keep
such; but now there is not that necessity, especially since the
vast accession of plants from the Cape and New-Holland, made

<p>It has fallen to the lot of this plant to have an unusual degree
of attention bestowed on it by various botanists, and after
being regarded as a distinct genus by several, to be finally
classed with the <i>Verbena</i>; in the <i>Supplementum Plantarum</i> of the
younger <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> it is minutely described.</p>

<p>We learn from the <i>Hortus Kewensis</i> of Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> that it is
a native of North-America, introduced by Mons. <span class="smcap">Richard</span> in
1774, and that it flowers in June and July.</p>

<p>The extreme brilliancy of its colours renders it a very ornamental
greenhouse plant, it seldom grows above the height of
two feet; in favourable seasons ripens its seeds readily, by
which it is usually propagated, being a biennial.</p>

<p>This singular and most beautiful species of Pelargonium,
recently introduced to this country, this Summer flowered
with Mr. <span class="smcap">Colvill</span>, Nurseryman, in the King's-Road, Chelsea,
from one of whose plants our figure and description have been
taken.</p>

<p>Stalk green, surface smooth and somewhat glossy, fleshy,
beset with spines which bend back and terminate in brownish
somewhat weak points; these appear to have been primarily
the stipulæ, which become thus fleshy and rigid, and from
this circumstance not altogether peculiar to this species, it takes
the name of <i>echinatum</i>; the leaves stand on long footstalks,
are somewhat heart-shaped, mostly roundish, divided into three
or five lobes, veiny, soft, and downy, especially on the under
side, which is of a much lighter colour than the upper, the
flowering stem proceeds from the summit of the stalk, and is
a foot or more in height; as it advances it throws out its
branches, or peduncles, ultimately about five in number, each
of which has a leaf at its base, similar to the other leaves of
the plant, but smaller, and terminates in an umbel of seven or
eight flowers; as the umbels blossom in succession, a period of
several months usually intervenes betwixt the blowing of the
first and the last; when the flower is expanded, the hindmost
leaf of the calyx continues upright, the others are reflexed as
in other species of this genus, they are all beset with fine long
hairs; the three lowermost petals are pure white, with a little
gibbosity at the base of each, the two uppermost are marked
each with three irregular spots, of a rich purple colour, inclining
to carmine, the two lowermost spots narrowest and of
the deepest colour; of the stamina there are six filaments which
have antheræ, and four of which have none; stigma red, divided
into five parts, and a little longer than the fertile filaments.</p>

<p>In its habit this plant resembles somewhat the <i>Pelargonium
cordifolium</i>, is a native of the Cape, flowers from May to September,
in favourable seasons has produced seeds here, but is
more usually increased by cuttings.</p>

<p>Varies with petals of a rich purple colour, in which the
spots are similar, though not so conspicuous.</p>

<p>There are few trees or shrubs which have contributed more
to adorn our plantations, and shrubberies, than those of this
genus, nine species of which are enumerated in the <i>Hort. Kew.</i>
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, most of these are natives either of North-America,
or Siberia: the present species, an inhabitant of
Carolina, is perhaps the most ornamental of the whole: its
large pendant bunches of rose-coloured flowers load the
branches in May and June, and sometimes a second crop will
be produced late in the season, these with us usually fall off
without producing any seed-vessels.</p>

<p>This shrub is not disposed to grow very tall in America,
it is most prudent indeed to keep it humble, to the height of
four or five feet, and to plant it in a sheltered part of the garden,
as its branches are liable to be broken by high winds:
<span class="smcap">Marshall</span> (<i>Arb. Amer.</i>) describes it as spreading much from
its running roots; we have not observed it to do so in any great
degree here; it is propagated by layers, by cuttings of the roots,
and by grafting; it is of ready growth, disposed to blow even
when young, and not nice as to soil, or situation; the flowers
afford a good example of the class <span class="smcap">Diadelphia</span>, they are
large and beautiful, but without scent.</p>

of the present plant and that of the <i>Linum arboreum</i> figured on
the 234th plate of this work, they are nevertheless two species
widely differing, the <i>flavum</i> being a hardy herbaceous perennial,
a native of Germany, the <i>arboreum</i> a greenhouse shrub from the
Levant, both possessing considerable beauty, and highly worthy
a place in all collections of ornamental plants.</p>

<p>The <i>Linum flavum</i> is not mentioned either in the Dictionary
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, or the Hortus Kewensis of Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, and
as far as our knowledge extends was a stranger in this country,
till we raised it the year before last from seeds sent us by

of hedges and among shrubs in mountainous situations, and
rarely exceeds a foot in height.</p>

<p>From the little experience we have had of this plant, it
appears to be easy of culture, and to succeed best in a soil moderately
stiff and moist; the flowers expand most in a morning
when the sun shines, and continue in succession during June,
July, and part of August; it appears as if it would ripen its
seeds in my garden; these vegetate freely: the plant may also
be increased by parting its roots in autumn, or by cuttings of
the young shoots.</p>

<p>This charming little shrub is a native of Switzerland and
Austria: <span class="smcap">Clusius</span> informs us that it grows in great abundance
on many of the mountains near Vienna, so much so that
women gather it when in flower and sell it in the markets; its
beautiful and fragrant blossoms come forth in April and May,
the principal season for its flowering, but it frequently blows
during most of the Summer, and even in the Autumn; it
varies with white blossoms.</p>

<p>It is extremely hardy, thrives remarkably well in road sand
in almost any situation; is propagated by seeds, which very
rarely ripen with us, by layers, and by grafting it on the stock
of the Mezereon, whereby it acquires an elevation superior to
what it has naturally.</p>

the first who described and figured this species of Genista, a
native of Corsica, and cultivated here by <span class="smcap">John Ord</span>, Esq.
as long since as the year 1770.</p>

<p>It is a hardy, evergreen, trailing shrub, producing a vast
profusion of bloom; which renders it eminently conspicuous
in May and June; its flowers are rarely succeeded by seed-vessels,
so that it is usually propagated by layers.</p>

<p>When tied up properly, and carefully trained to stake, it
may vie with most of our ornamental shrubs: for covering a
wall, or paling, where the situation is not too shady, it probably
would succeed very well, at least it is deserving of trial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clusius</span>, in his <i>Hist. Pl. rar.</i> gives an accurate description
and good figure of the present plant, before unnoticed (as he
observes) by any author; it has since been particularly described
by <span class="smcap">Haller</span> and <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span>; the former makes a distinct genus
of it, by the name of <i>Polygaloides</i>.</p>

<p>It is an elegant little evergreen shrub of low growth, rarely
exceeding a foot in height, with leaves like those of box,
producing flowers from May to October, but most plentifully
in May and June; each flower stands on a peduncle proceeding
from a kind of triphyllous cup, formed of floral leaves, the
true calyx is composed of three leaves, which are nearly white;
the two outermost petals, similar to the wings of a papilionaceous
flower, are also white, or nearly so; the third petal
which forms a kind of tube and contains the eight stamina with
the pistillum, is white at the base, but yellow towards the extremity,
where it changes by degrees to a bright bay colour:
both <span class="smcap">Clusius</span> and <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span> observed a variety of this plant,
in which the calyx and wings were of a beautiful purple; this
variety, we believe, has not yet been introduced to this country:
the common sort was cultivated in the garden at Oxford, in 1658.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miller</span> describes it as a plant difficult of cultivation; it is
not now regarded as such; both <span class="smcap">Clusius</span> and <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span> describe
it as having creeping roots; such plants are generally increased
without difficulty, and so is this; planted in bog earth
on a shady border, it thrives extremely well, and spawns much,
so that there is no necessity for having recourse to its seeds. It
grows spontaneously on the Alps of Austria and Switzerland.</p>

<p>This charming little shrub, highly deserving of being more
generally known, is a native of the South of France; and
was cultivated here by <span class="smcap">Miller</span> in 1748.</p>

<p>In favourable situations, it produces blossoms in great
profusion during most of the Summer, and ripens seed in
abundance: the situation it affects is dry and sandy, but it is a
shrub by no means nice, as to soil or place of growth, and so
hardy as to have borne the severity of last Winter, 1795,
without injury.</p>

<p>In the collections about town we frequently find it in pots,
kept with greenhouse plants.</p>

<p>It is said to vary with white flowers.</p>

<p>The best mode of raising it is from seed.</p>

<p>Botanists are divided in their opinions respecting the genus of
this plant; <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> considers it as an <i>Anthericum</i>, <span class="smcap">Haller</span>
and <span class="smcap">Miller</span> make it an <i>Hemerocallis</i>.</p>

<p>It is a native of Switzerland, where, <span class="smcap">Haller</span> informs us,
it grows abundantly in the Alpine meadows, and even on the
summits of the mountains; with us it flowers in May and June.</p>

<p>It is a plant of great elegance, producing on an unbranched
stem about a foot and a half high, numerous flowers of a delicate
white colour, much smaller but resembling in form those
of the common white lily, possessing a considerable degree of
fragrance, their beauty is heightened by the rich orange colour
of their antheræ; unfortunately they are but of short duration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miller</span> describes two varieties of it differing merely in
size.</p>

<p>A loamy soil, a situation moderately moist, with an eastern
or western exposure, suits this plant best; so situated, it will
increase by its roots, though not very fast, and by parting of
these in the autumn, it is usually propagated.</p>

<p>In Italy and Spain, where this plant grows spontaneously, it
is an annual, producing seed in abundance; with us (as far at
least as we have observed) it produces no seed, but like the
<i>Senecio elegans</i>, and some other annuals, is renewed, and rendered
perennial by cuttings, which strike freely, and by which
the plant requires to be renovated once or twice in a season;
though described as growing with an upright stem, it requires
to be tied up to a stick; and if this be neatly and dexterously
done, its brilliant azure flowers springing from every side of
the stem, render it a charming ornament for the greenhouse
or window: it flowers during most of the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clusius</span> called it <i>Anagallis Monnelli</i>, the first knowledge he

<p>This species of <i>Lobelia</i>, so eminently distinguished for the
richness of its scarlet blossoms, is a native of the colder as well
as warmer parts of North-America. <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, who cultivated
it in 1629, informs us that he received plants of it from
France for his garden, and that "it groweth neere the river of
Canada, where the French plantation in America is seated."</p>

<p>It is a hardy herbaceous plant, growing in favourable situations
to the height of three or four feet; the main spike of
flowers which terminates the stalk, is often a foot in length;
by the time that most of its flowers are blown, side branches
shoot out, and flower; so that the plant continues in bloom
six weeks or two months: if the Autumn prove favourable,
the plant with us produces plenty of seed in the open ground;
to insure its ripening, some place pots of it, when blowing,
in the greenhouse or stove.</p>

<p>Beautiful and hardy as this plant is, and long as it has been
introduced to this country, we do not find it generally in
gardens; we attribute this to its having, in a greater degree
than many other plants, a partiality for a particular soil; in
certain districts, where the soil is stiff and moist, it grows as
freely as any weed, in other soils it is perpetually going off:
it is also one of those plants whose roots require to be often
parted; if this be done every Autumn, and they be planted in
a stiff loam, the situation somewhat moist and shady, this very
desirable plant may be had to grow and blossom in perfection.</p>

<p>It flowers from the latter end of July to October.</p>

<p>Is increased by parting its roots, by cuttings of the stalk
and from seed.</p>

retains a place in most collections, deservedly indeed, for it has
every claim to our notice; its appearance is magnificent, the
glaucous colour of its foliage highly pleasing, its flowers large
and of long duration; it blows freely, grows rapidly, is easily
increased by cuttings, and will succeed in a house or window,
with the common treatment of an African Geranium.</p>

<p>When suffered to grow, it will become a shrub of considerable
size; but this is not necessary for its flowering, as young and
small plants are disposed to throw out blossoms, which is not
the case with a plant extremely similar to, and often confounded
with it, viz. the <i>Crassula Cotyledon</i>, whose foliage
indeed scarcely differs from our plant but in being finely
dotted.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Cape, and flowers from June or
July to September.</p>

he describes it more minutely, and changes it to the Genus
<i>Manulea</i>, first established by him in the said work; he observes,
that in this species the corolla is more regular than in the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> regards it as a biennial, its stalk is a foot or a
foot and a half high, and woolly, its branches are opposite, not
alternate as <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> describes them; in this perhaps they may
vary; leaves opposite, sessile, obovate, narrowing to the base,
toothed on the edge, edge rolled back a little in the young
leaves, flowers grow in a long thyrsus, from two to five proceed
from one common short peduncle; they are at first lemon-coloured,
or greenish yellow, finally deep orange; <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>
says the whole of the plant except the corolla is woolly, the tube
of that even is hairy, the segments are smooth, with their edges
rolled back, the upper part of the tube in which the stamina
are included is dilated somewhat, as is also the lower part, so
that it is narrowest in the middle. The flowers which make
their appearance from May to November are usually succeeded
by seeds, by which the plant is propagated.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Cape, and, according to Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>,
was introduced by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>, in 1774.</p>

<p>The blossoms have a singular but unpleasant smell, not perceivable
at a distance.</p>

<p>The variety of pleasant colours so conspicuous in the flowers,
renders this rare plant desirable to such as aim at a general
collection.</p>

<p>Botanists and Gardeners have given to this species of Rubus
the name of <i>flowering</i>, not because it is the only one which
produces flowers, but from its being regarded for its flowers
merely; they indeed are so shewy, and so plentifully produced,
that the plant has long been thought to merit a place in most
shrubberies; to the various inhabitants of which, both in the
largeness and elegant form of its leaves, and the colour of its
blossoms, it forms a pleasing contrast.</p>

<p>It is extremely hardy, and easily propagated by suckers;
the only care which it requires, is to keep it within proper
bounds: young plants of it produce the largest and finest
flowers.</p>

<p>It blossoms from June to September, is a native of different
and distant parts of North-America, and was cultivated here
by Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, in 1739.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornutus</span>, who first figured and described this plant,
gave it the name of <i>odoratus</i>, on account of the fragrance of
its foliage; his words are "elegantissimi hujus folia fragrantissima
sunt, paremque agrimonio odorato spirant odorem;"
the fruit, rarely produced with us, he observes, is like the
common Raspberry, but not so pleasant.</p>

<p>The <i>Antirrhinum triphyllum</i>, so called from the leaves growing
by threes on the stalk (a character, by the bye, not very
constant) was cultivated by <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, and described by
him in his <i>Parad. terr.</i> He appears to have been a stranger to
the particoloured variety now so generally cultivated as an
ornamental annual in our gardens; in its wild state the flowers
of this <i>Antirrhinum</i> are of a yellow hue, with little or no
purple in them, such indeed are frequently produced from
seeds sown in our gardens.</p>

<p>It is a hardy annual, a native of Spain and Sicily, a plant
of ready growth, requiring the common treatment of annuals
sown in the Spring, and much disposed indeed to come up
spontaneously where it has once grown; in sowing its seeds,
care should be taken to preserve the produce of such flowers
as have the most purple in them.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
